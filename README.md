# maze_type_game

I have done it in graphic library.Array  and reactangle is widely used.

Challenges:
    • Designing the maze
    • movement of enemy
    • location of food
    • control of the persion to move in defined path
    • score obtained and left remaining in the game

Soln:
    • store the value of every cordinate of maze in array.
    • Use flag to recursively run enemy in fixed path
    • store the all possible food location and storing in array and selecting randomly
    • while moving x-direction check the value of x-cordinate and same rule apply for while moving in y-direction
    • if cordinate of person match any cordinate of enemy ,life is decreased
    • if cordinate of person match with food , score is obtained

you can check vedio in Issue on topbar
